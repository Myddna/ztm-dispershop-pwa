# ZTM Course Shop Project

This is the project for the ZTM Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL) course.

## About this version

Although the course name said '2022' in it's title, it was not entirely updated.

I've built this sample project with more recent dependencies and code styles (functional components instead of extending React.Component and use of hooks, for example).

Be warned, the naming convention used for this code is not the same that is used throughout the course. See `.eslintrc.js` for details (and maybe https://dev.to/knowankit/setup-eslint-and-prettier-in-react-app-357b)

## About the styling

At the time of writing this, I've styled lots of HTML and some styledComponents. The original project does not use StyledComponents as I am doing, so the scss structure is not optimal (I'm sure we don't need styles nesting neither SCSS for this project).

May be I'll fix it later.
